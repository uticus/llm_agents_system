## What this project is

llm_agents_system is a Python platform for building and orchestrating LLM-based agent systems: model hub (OpenAI/HuggingFace/GGUF via llama.cpp/vLLM), data ingestion, RAG, agent capabilities (memory, planning, tools, hierarchy), serving, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary language | Python 3.12+ |
| Bindings | none |
| Build | uv (pyproject.toml); heavy integrations behind optional extras |
| Toolchain | CPython 3.12+, ruff, pytest |
| MCP tools | see `.cursor/mcp/registry.md` |

---

## Non-negotiable rules

These rules apply to every agent at every phase. No exceptions.

1. External dependencies are immutable. Never propose or make changes to fetched dependencies.
2. English only. No other languages in any project file.
3. No emojis in any file.
4. Always run tools from the project root. Never `cd` into subdirectories.
5. Use structural search tools before text search. Available MCP tools: `.cursor/mcp/registry.md`.
   Grep only for string literals and comments.
6. Capture search results after each step before running the next search.
7. Public API changes require full impact analysis: headers + tests + bindings + examples.
8. Integration tests must replicate real usage scripts exactly. Do not reorder or optimize commands.
9. Each agent reads only what its role definition specifies. No browsing unrelated files.
10. Memory writer is responsible for knowledge continuity: persisting decisions and context
    across sessions, tasks, and time. Who writes what and where is defined in
    `.cursor/pipeline/pipeline.md`.

CRITICAL: always follow pipeline to process request

## How to identify your role

Your role is stated in the task or session prompt.
If no role is stated — ask the developer which role to activate before doing anything else.

Available roles:

| Role | File | Activated when |
|---|---|---|
| Analyst | `.cursor/agents/analyst.md` | Developer starts a new request |
| Decomposer | `.cursor/agents/decomposer.md` | Request is ready to split into task cards |
| Architect | `.cursor/agents/architect.md` | Design phase starts for a task card |
| Planner | `.cursor/agents/planner.md` | Architecture section of task card is complete |
| Critic | `.cursor/agents/critic.md` | Planner produces a plan draft |
| Spec writer | `.cursor/agents/spec-writer.md` | Plan is approved by developer |
| Test designer | `.cursor/agents/test-designer.md` | Spec is written |
| Environment | `.cursor/agents/environment.md` | Spec and test criteria are approved |
| Impl: Python | `.cursor/agents/implementer-python.md` | Environment is ready (primary implementer — this is a Python project) |
| Impl: ML | `.cursor/agents/implementer-ml.md` | Environment is ready, task requires ML (fine-tuning, local inference, embeddings, RAG models) |
| Impl: C++ | _inactive_ — moved to `.cursor/_unused/` | Not applicable (no C++ in this project) |
| Analyst: Code | `.cursor/agents/analyst-code.md` | CP2 approved, implementer type is `code-analyst` — task reads code and produces markdown artifacts only; Phases 3–4 and Reviewer+Tester loop are skipped |
| Reviewer | `.cursor/agents/reviewer.md` | Implementation is ready for review |
| Tester | `.cursor/agents/tester.md` | Implementation passes Reviewer |
| Memory writer | `.cursor/agents/memory-writer.md` | Called by any agent or developer as needed |

## What to read next

After this file, read in order:

1. Your agent role file from `.cursor/agents/<role>.md`
   — it specifies exactly what to read, what to write, which skills and rules to load, and when to stop.

2. `.cursor/pipeline/pipeline.md`
   — read if you need to understand the full flow, your position in it, or handoff rules.

3. Your task card: `tasks/active/task-NNN.md`
   — read only the sections relevant to your phase (listed in your role file).

4. Memory files listed in your role definition
   — read only the files listed. Do not browse `memory/**` freely.

Do not read files not listed in your role definition.
Do not read other agents' task cards or session files.

    analysis/
      <topic>.md                   results of code analysis, research spikes
```

---

## Memory file status

Current state of all memory files (what exists, what does not):
see `.cursor/memory/status.md`

Memory writer maintains that file. Agents read it before accessing any memory file.

---

## Checkpoints — where control returns to the developer

| CP | After | Developer decides |
|---|---|---|
| CP1 | Decomposer | go / edit / send back to Analyst |
| CP2 | Planner + Critic + Architect loop | go / revise → loop |
| CP3 | Spec writer + Test designer | go / adjust |
| CP4 | Environment | go / fix env |
| CP5 | Reviewer + Tester loop (impl tasks) / Analyst: Code (code-analyst tasks) | merge / rework → loop / escalate to CP2 |

An agent must stop and surface output for developer review at every checkpoint.
An agent must not proceed past a checkpoint without explicit developer approval.

---

## Output conventions

- Always show the full file path before any code block.
- Write decisions with trade-off changes to `.cursor/memory/decisions/adr-log.md` via Memory writer.
- Write session progress to `.cursor/tasks/sessions/task-NNN-<phase>.md` continuously.
- Write final clean artifacts to `.cursor/tasks/decisions/` only when the loop stop condition is met.
- When a new file is created under the main source tree: flag it for inventory update.
- When public API changes: flag it — ABI check required.
